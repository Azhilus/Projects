# SWEMP | Smart Wearable for Enhanced Mine Protection

SWEMP is a smart wearable device designed for miners, integrating real-time hazard monitoring and alert systems using Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32, and ESP8266. The device monitors environmental conditions and communicates with a local server to ensure safety in mineshafts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hazard Monitoring**: Implemented MQTT protocol to set up a real-time hazard monitoring and alert system for mineshaft protection.
- **Sensor Integration**: Integrated various optical and resistive sensors for accurate environmental analysis.
- **Reliable Communication**: Addressing the need for dependable communication in low-bandwidth environments with ongoing integration of LoRa and other high-speed, low-bandwidth communication protocols.

## Goal

The goal of SWEMP was to build a compact, wearable device for miners that comfortably monitors their environment. The device maintains bidirectional communication with a local Raspberry Pi server, which continuously monitors sensor readings and publishes alerts when threats are detected. Reliable communication in challenging, low-bandwidth environments is critical to ensure timely and accurate alerts.

## Achievements

- **2nd Prize**: Awarded 2nd Prize at Mind Installers Hackathon 2.0 at IIMT.
